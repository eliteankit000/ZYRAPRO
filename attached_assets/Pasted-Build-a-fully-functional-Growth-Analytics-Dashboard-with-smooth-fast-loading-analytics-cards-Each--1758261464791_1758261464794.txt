Build a fully functional Growth Analytics Dashboard with smooth, fast-loading analytics cards. Each card should connect to live data, APIs, and Supabase for storage + tracking.

üîπ Page Layout & UX

Use a grid-based responsive layout (3 cards per row on desktop, 1‚Äì2 on mobile).

Each card must have:

Title + short description.

"Action Button" (e.g., View Products, View Analytics).

Smooth hover animation + subtle shadow for interactivity.

Dashboard should load instantly, using lazy data fetching (fetch data only when user clicks "View").
